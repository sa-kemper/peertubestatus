    "description": "The PeerTube API is built on HTTP(S) and is RESTful. You can use your favorite\nHTTP/REST library for your programming language to use PeerTube.\n\nSee the [REST API quick start](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api/rest-getting-started) for a few\nexamples of using the PeerTube API.\n\n# Authentication\n\nWhen you sign up for an account on a PeerTube instance, you are given the possibility\nto generate sessions on it, and authenticate there using an access token. Only __one\naccess token can currently be used at a time__.\n\n## Roles\n\nAccounts are given permissions based on their role. There are three roles on\nPeerTube: Administrator, Moderator, and User. See the [roles guide](https://docs.joinpeertube.org/admin/managing-users#roles) for a detail of their permissions.\n\n# Errors\n\nThe API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure\nof the API call, completed by a [RFC7807-compliant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) response body.\n\n```\nHTTP 1.1 404 Not Found\nContent-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8\n\n{\n  \"detail\": \"Video not found\",\n  \"docs\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo\",\n  \"status\": 404,\n  \"title\": \"Not Found\",\n  \"type\": \"about:blank\"\n}\n```\n\nWe provide error `type` (following RFC7807) and `code` (internal PeerTube code) values for [a growing number of cases](https://github.com/Chocobozzz/PeerTube/blob/develop/packages/models/src/server/server-error-code.enum.ts),\nbut it is still optional. Types are used to disambiguate errors that bear the same status code\nand are non-obvious:\n\n```\nHTTP 1.1 403 Forbidden\nContent-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8\n\n{\n  \"detail\": \"Cannot get this video regarding follow constraints\",\n  \"docs\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo\",\n  \"status\": 403,\n  \"title\": \"Forbidden\",\n  \"type\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#section/Errors/does_not_respect_follow_constraints\"\n}\n```\n\nHere a 403 error could otherwise mean that the video is private or blocklisted.\n\n### Validation errors\n\nEach parameter is evaluated on its own against a set of rules before the route validator\nproceeds with potential testing involving parameter combinations. Errors coming from validation\nerrors appear earlier and benefit from a more detailed error description:\n\n```\nHTTP 1.1 400 Bad Request\nContent-Type: application/problem+json; charset=utf-8\n\n{\n  \"detail\": \"Incorrect request parameters: id\",\n  \"docs\": \"https://docs.joinpeertube.org/api-rest-reference.html#operation/getVideo\",\n  \"instance\": \"/api/v1/videos/9c9de5e8-0a1e-484a-b099-e80766180\",\n  \"invalid-params\": {\n    \"id\": {\n      \"location\": \"params\",\n      \"msg\": \"Invalid value\",\n      \"param\": \"id\",\n      \"value\": \"9c9de5e8-0a1e-484a-b099-e80766180\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"status\": 400,\n  \"title\": \"Bad Request\",\n  \"type\": \"about:blank\"\n}\n```\n\nWhere `id` is the name of the field concerned by the error, within the route definition.\n`invalid-params.<field>.location` can be either 'params', 'body', 'header', 'query' or 'cookies', and\n`invalid-params.<field>.value` reports the value that didn't pass validation whose `invalid-params.<field>.msg`\nis about.\n\n### Deprecated error fields\n\nSome fields could be included with previous versions. They are still included but their use is deprecated:\n- `error`: superseded by `detail`\n\n# Rate limits\n\nWe are rate-limiting all endpoints of PeerTube's API. Custom values can be set by administrators:\n\n| Endpoint (prefix: `/api/v1`) | Calls         | Time frame   |\n|------------------------------|---------------|--------------|\n| `/*`                         | 50            | 10 seconds   |\n| `POST /users/token`          | 15            | 5 minutes    |\n| `POST /users/register`       | 2<sup>*</sup> | 5 minutes    |\n| `POST /users/ask-send-verify-email` | 3      | 5 minutes    |\n\nDepending on the endpoint, <sup>*</sup>failed requests are not taken into account. A service\nlimit is announced by a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.\n\nYou can get details about the current state of your rate limit by reading the\nfollowing headers:\n\n| Header                  | Description                                                |\n|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|\n| `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | Number of max requests allowed in the current time period  |\n| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Number of remaining requests in the current time period    |\n| `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | Timestamp of end of current time period as UNIX timestamp  |\n| `Retry-After`           | Seconds to delay after the first `429` is received         |\n\n# CORS\n\nThis API features [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/),\nallowing cross-domain communication from the browser for some routes:\n\n| Endpoint                    |\n|------------------------- ---|\n| `/api/*`                    |\n| `/download/*`               |\n| `/lazy-static/*`            |\n| `/.well-known/webfinger`    |\n\nIn addition, all routes serving ActivityPub are CORS-enabled for all origins.\n"

Its protocol lets\nyou resume an upload operation after a network interruption or other transmission failure,\nsaving time and bandwidth in the event of network failures.\n\nFavor using resumable uploads in any of the following cases:\n- You are transferring large files\n- The likelihood of a network interruption is high\n- Uploads are originating from a device with a low-bandwidth or unstable Internet connection,\n  such as a mobile device\n\n### Import\n\n- _URL_-based: where the URL points to any service supported by [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/)\n- _magnet_-based: where the URI resolves to a BitTorrent resource containing a single supported video file\n- _torrent_-based: where the metainfo file resolves to a BitTorrent resource containing a single supported video file\n\nThe import function is practical when the desired video/audio is available online. It makes PeerTube\ndownload it for you, saving you as much bandwidth and avoiding any instability or limitation your network might have.\n"

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Et si les plantes les plus utiles de votre jardin… n’étaient pas celles que vous récoltez ?<br />\nDans cette vidéo, je vous parle d’une catégorie de plantes trop souvent oubliées : les plantes de service (ou AFI – Architecturales, Fertilisantes, Ingénieures).<br />\nCes arbres, arbustes et herbacées ne sont pas forcément là pour nourrir directement… mais pour rendre votre jardin plus fertile, plus productif, plus équilibré et plus vivant.</p>\n<p>Pourquoi c’est important ?</p>\n<p>Parce qu’un jardin, ce n’est pas seulement une addition de plantes à récolter.<br />\nC’est un écosystème vivant : et si on pense uniquement à nos besoins, on finit par perdre l’équilibre naturel.<br />\nEn intégrant des plantes de service, on construit un jardin résilient, productif et durable… exactement comme un écosystème sauvage.</p>\n<p>💬 À vous de jouer !</p>\n<p>👉 Comment vous appelez ces plantes : AFI ou plantes de service ?<br />\n👉 Est-ce que vous connaissiez leur rôle dans un jardin-forêt ou en permaculture ?<br />\nPartagez vos réponses en commentaire, j’ai hâte de vous lire !</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adhérez à cette chaîne pour obtenir des avantages :<br />\n<a

La décision a été prise avec une cohorte de pays occidentaux dont la Belgique, le Canada, ou encore le Royaume-Uni. Une sorte de « freinage doux », pour reprendre les mots de notre invité le professeur Bertand Badie, face aux atrocités génocidaires commises par le gouvernement israélien à Gaza. Et qui ne sera véritablement efficace que s’il est accompagné de sanctions économiques.</p>\n<p>Reste ainsi encore à voir si les États occidentaux, à l’exception des États-Unis, ont vraiment comme objectif de faire s’arrêter les massacres et la colonisation. Car si tel n’est pas le cas, cette décision ne viendra en rien atténuer le tragique constat qui s’impose : la complicité au pire des crimes.</p>\n<p>Journaliste : Maxime Cochelin<br />\nMontage :

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Et si les plantes les plus utiles de votre jardin… n’étaient pas celles que vous récoltez ?<br />\nDans cette vidéo, je vous parle d’une catégorie de plantes trop souvent oubliées : les plantes de service (ou AFI – Architecturales, Fertilisantes, Ingénieures).<br />\nCes arbres, arbustes et herbacées ne sont pas forcément là pour nourrir directement… mais pour rendre votre jardin plus fertile, plus productif, plus équilibré et plus vivant.</p>\n<p>Pourquoi c’est important ?</p>\n<p>Parce qu’un jardin, ce n’est pas seulement une addition de plantes à récolter.<br />\nC’est un écosystème vivant : et si on pense uniquement à nos besoins, on finit par perdre l’équilibre naturel.<br />\nEn intégrant des plantes de service, on construit un jardin résilient, productif et durable… exactement comme un écosystème sauvage.</p>\n<p>💬 À vous de jouer !</p>\n<p>👉 Comment vous appelez ces plantes : AFI ou plantes de service ?<br />\n👉 Est-ce que vous connaissiez leur rôle dans un jardin-forêt ou en permaculture ?<br />\nPartagez vos réponses en commentaire, j’ai hâte de vous lire !</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adhérez à cette chaîne pour obtenir des avantages :<br />\n<a

La décision a été prise avec une cohorte de pays occidentaux dont la Belgique, le Canada, ou encore le Royaume-Uni. Une sorte de « freinage doux », pour reprendre les mots de notre invité le professeur Bertand Badie, face aux atrocités génocidaires commises par le gouvernement israélien à Gaza. Et qui ne sera véritablement efficace que s’il est accompagné de sanctions économiques.</p>\n<p>Reste ainsi encore à voir si les États occidentaux, à l’exception des États-Unis, ont vraiment comme objectif de faire s’arrêter les massacres et la colonisation. Car si tel n’est pas le cas, cette décision ne viendra en rien atténuer le tragique constat qui s’impose : la complicité au pire des crimes.</p>\n<p>Journaliste : Maxime Cochelin<br />\nMontage :

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Et si les plantes les plus utiles de votre jardin… n’étaient pas celles que vous récoltez ?<br />\nDans cette vidéo, je vous parle d’une catégorie de plantes trop souvent oubliées : les plantes de service (ou AFI – Architecturales, Fertilisantes, Ingénieures).<br />\nCes arbres, arbustes et herbacées ne sont pas forcément là pour nourrir directement… mais pour rendre votre jardin plus fertile, plus productif, plus équilibré et plus vivant.</p>\n<p>Pourquoi c’est important ?</p>\n<p>Parce qu’un jardin, ce n’est pas seulement une addition de plantes à récolter.<br />\nC’est un écosystème vivant : et si on pense uniquement à nos besoins, on finit par perdre l’équilibre naturel.<br />\nEn intégrant des plantes de service, on construit un jardin résilient, productif et durable… exactement comme un écosystème sauvage.</p>\n<p>💬 À vous de jouer !</p>\n<p>👉 Comment vous appelez ces plantes : AFI ou plantes de service ?<br />\n👉 Est-ce que vous connaissiez leur rôle dans un jardin-forêt ou en permaculture ?<br />\nPartagez vos réponses en commentaire, j’ai hâte de vous lire !</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adhérez à cette chaîne pour obtenir des avantages :<br />\n<a

La décision a été prise avec une cohorte de pays occidentaux dont la Belgique, le Canada, ou encore le Royaume-Uni. Une sorte de « freinage doux », pour reprendre les mots de notre invité le professeur Bertand Badie, face aux atrocités génocidaires commises par le gouvernement israélien à Gaza. Et qui ne sera véritablement efficace que s’il est accompagné de sanctions économiques.</p>\n<p>Reste ainsi encore à voir si les États occidentaux, à l’exception des États-Unis, ont vraiment comme objectif de faire s’arrêter les massacres et la colonisation. Car si tel n’est pas le cas, cette décision ne viendra en rien atténuer le tragique constat qui s’impose : la complicité au pire des crimes.</p>\n<p>Journaliste : Maxime Cochelin<br />\nMontage :

La décision a été prise avec une cohorte de pays occidentaux dont la Belgique, le Canada, ou encore le Royaume-Uni. Une sorte de « freinage doux », pour reprendre les mots de notre invité le professeur Bertand Badie, face aux atrocités génocidaires commises par le gouvernement israélien à Gaza. Et qui ne sera véritablement efficace que s’il est accompagné de sanctions économiques.</p>\n<p>Reste ainsi encore à voir si les États occidentaux, à l’exception des États-Unis, ont vraiment comme objectif de faire s’arrêter les massacres et la colonisation.

La décision a été prise avec une cohorte de pays occidentaux dont la Belgique, le Canada, ou encore le Royaume-Uni. Une sorte de « freinage doux », pour reprendre les mots de notre invité le professeur Bertand Badie, face aux atrocités génocidaires commises par le gouvernement israélien à Gaza. Et qui ne sera véritablement efficace que s’il est accompagné de sanctions économiques.</p>\n<p>Reste ainsi encore à voir si les États occidentaux, à l’exception des États-Unis, ont vraiment comme objectif de faire s’arrêter les massacres et la colonisation. Car si tel n’est pas le cas, cette décision ne viendra en rien atténuer le tragique constat qui s’impose : la complicité au pire des crimes.</p>\n<p>Journaliste : Maxime Cochelin<br />\nMontage : Alexandre Cassier<br />\nSon : Baptiste Veilhan, Théo Duchesne<br />\nGraphisme : Morgane Sabouret, Margaux Simon<br />\nProduction : Hicham Tragha<br />\nDirecteur du développement des collaborations extérieures : Mathias Enthoven<br />\nCo-directrice de la rédaction : Soumaya Benaïssa<br />\nDirecteur de la publication : Denis Robert</p>\n<p>Le site : <a href=\"https://www.blast-info.fr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.blast-info.fr/</a><br />\nFacebook : <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/blastofficiel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.facebook.com/blastofficiel</a><br />\nTwitter : <a href=\"https://twitter.com/blast_france\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://twitter.com/blast_france</a><br />\nInstagram : <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/blastofficiel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.instagram.com/blastofficiel/</a><br />\nMastodon : <a href=\"https://mamot.fr/web/@blast_info\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://mamot.fr/web/@blast_info</a><br />\nPeertube : <a href=\"https://video.blast-info.fr/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://video.blast-info.fr/</a><br />\nTwitch : <a href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/blastinfo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.twitch.tv/blastinfo</a><br />\nBluesky : <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/blast-info.fr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://bsky.app/profile/blast-info.fr</a></p>\n<p>#Palestine<br />\n#Macron<br />\n#ONU</p>\n",
